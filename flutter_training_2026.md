## Flutter training 2026 at TH Aschaffenburg 

Starting Feb. 2026 I plan to offer a Flutter training for the Software Design students at TH Aschaffenburg.

At the end of the training the students should be able to

- install and use a Flutter development environment with VS Code on their machines
- create a Hello World app and display texts and images therein
- use buttons, switches, sliders and other UI elements to interact with the user
- write own components in Dart and corresponding automated tests
- measure the line coverage of these tests
- explain what is meant with "sound null safety" in Dart
- use asynchronous programming in Dart to read data from a Web API
- create dynamic effects in the UI by using timers
- react on user gestures like panning
- use external packages to display e.g. gauges or charts in a flutter app
- visualize zoomable maps in an app and display e.g. a rain radar therein
- build apk or app bundle files to install the apps on Android devices
- publish the apps via GitHub pages as Web aps

Short info about the trainer: </br>
My name is Günther Schmitt, I worked nearly 40 years as software engineer, the last 20 years at Schneider Electric developing Windows apps with C++ and C#. After my retirement in 2021 I wanted to learn writing code for Android. First I used .Net and Microsoft MAUI, but then I came across Flutter and enjoyed working with it. Since 2023 I offer Flutter trainings for young students to share my knowledge and my fun in coding.

<h1 id="test-two-pages-in-our-canasta-calculator">Test two pages in our canasta calculator</h1>
<p>These versions are based on the code reached at the end of our training on 03-May-2024. </p>
<p>You see this version under <a href="https://guentherschmitt.github.io/web_test/canasta_two_pages/v01_from_20240503">v01_from_20240503</a> </p>
<p>In this first version we had the issue that only one or two digits could be entered for text field &quot;Canasta points&quot;.<br>
This was fixed in version <a href="https://guentherschmitt.github.io/web_test/canasta_two_pages/v02_selection_issue_fixed">v02_selection_issue_fixed</a>  </p>
<p>A first possibility to have two &quot;pages&quot; is to use a TabBar.
You can find this in <a href="https://guentherschmitt.github.io/web_test/canasta_two_pages/v02a_tabbar">v02a_tabbar</a></p>
<p>Another one is to use a page view and optionally a drawer (hamburger menu) to let the user know about the second pages.
This is implemented in <a href="https://guentherschmitt.github.io/web_test/canasta_two_pages/v02b_pageview">v02b_pageview</a></p>
<p>Finally you can use page navigation, which can be tested in
